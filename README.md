# Hotel_Bookings

Dashboard to visualize Hotel Bookings as well as some Agent information.

This interactive Dashboard was created to visualize Hotel Bookings as well as some Agent information. I was able to uncover various insights ranging from ;

• the proportion at which customers(guests) repeated their hotel bookings in the 2 hotels; this helps us have a sneak peek of the hotel our customers prefer due to range of
multiple reasons like Location, Meal types served, Service Quality and so on

• customer types had to be looked into to actually understand the exact type of customer that have booked the hotel, so the hotels can channel their focus on improving their
Service Quality to suit these customers and at the same time try to find new ways in making other types of customers book their hotels more. The "Transient and Transient
party" type customers really are the top customers who really are known as the last minute bookers that stay for a short period of time. More Entertainment programs
maybe like Friday or weekend shows incorporated in the hotel's schedule could be a cool way to bring more of these types of customers back to the hotels.

• Food as they say is very important as it maintains life and growth, which was i took interest in looking at the Meal types and how it can affect guests booking the hotels. The
Dashboard being interactive helped showcase that in City Hotel, Self Catering meals which ordinarily are not included in the price, but guests have access to the Kitchen was
among the highest meal type consumed in he Hotel. This brings to mind Resort Hotel implementing this meal type strategy fully to aid more guests booking their hotels.

• Distribution Channel is a major factor in boosting hotel bookings. From the dataset, we deduced that Travel Agency/ Tour Operators (TA/TO) were the most used channel,
But Most Hotels more often than not prefer Direct Bookings due to low acquisition cost and how at least cost are controlled to a minimal favoring A.D.R. Hotels can revamp
their primary website to be top notch, advertise and encourage direct phone bookings and also even via social platforms.

• Also same way other concepts are key, Finance is important. A simple viz of The A.D.R by year was visualized to ascertain the trend of average revenue the hotels has been
receiving for each occupied guest room over the years. This enables see how the hotels have been dealing with income. Notice there's a down ward slope for the year 2016 -
2017.This might be due to low bookings during the year as guests don't use the hotels. This would still fall down in boosting various key areas of the hotel to encourage
more guests booking and also repeated guest re-booking.

### RECOMMENDED AGENTS

From the viz. of 'Agent Booking's Info': I managed to get the Top 10 Agents based on the no of Bookings they handled over the years and no of Booking changes they have
granted, since a guest can reschedule or try to change his/her bookings or transfer the booking to his family member as benefactor. Things might likely come up at any time. In
a nutshell, any agent that really grants Booking changes and has handled large amount of Bookings should be recommended.
So to our client, SHUBOMI and SONS, we will recommend

Agent with ID 9

Agent with ID 240

Agent with ID 1

Agent with 1D 14

Agent with 1D 7
